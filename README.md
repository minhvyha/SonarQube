### About this project
I have started a new journey with CS50W, a course from Harvard University. This course covers database design, scalability, security, user experience and fundamentals of web design. This course evaluates your skills through hands-on projects to help you gain experience writing and using APIs, create interactive UIs, and leverage cloud services like GitHub and Heroku.
